## ABOUT C A G U W A 

Caguwa is a web platform in Kigali which helps people to buy and sell their used products.
as we know human being like the changes, so every thing we use in our daily life we like them when they are still new and use them as we want , but sometimes we need to change the property even when there is nothing wrong with it especially when we no longer use it.

but to other side of life they are people out there who will be happy to use that property that you used,
yeah they are because we are all not on the same financial level!
so in this town of kigali i've seen how the second hand products are most wanted especially how cheap they are and said why not helping my community to access them in a digital way!

i can't say that there is no way to buy and sell second hand things but they are not perfect , and i think this platform can help a lot on side of trust and security!
